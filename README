Google Wave Notifier Plus
=========================

This is a chrome extension, derived from the official notifier, but
extended in under 24 hours of hacking to support multiple domains.

Upcoming goals are to add sound and animation to the notifications,
along with the development goal of making the oauth library completely
re-entrant, so that authorization and information retrieval may proceed
in parallel for multiple domains. (Also, the request frequency and
number of waves to fetch will be made configuration very shortly.)
